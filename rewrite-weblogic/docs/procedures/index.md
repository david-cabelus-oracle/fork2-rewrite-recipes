# How to run recipes

Depending on your application dependencies and WebLogic Server and JDK source versions, you can use one or more recipes to accomplish your goals. Recipes are stackable; you can run more than one recipe at a time, within a single command or Maven configuration; recipes are run in order.

You can run OpenRewrite recipes on your code folder using the Maven or Gradle CLI, or include them as a build plug-in in your `pom.xml` file. For more details on running the recipes with Maven and Gradle, see the [OpenRewrite Quickstart](https://docs.openrewrite.org/running-recipes/getting-started) documentation.
