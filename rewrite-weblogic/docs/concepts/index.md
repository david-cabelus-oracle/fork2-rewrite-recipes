# What Is WebLogic Server Application Upgrade Tooling

WebLogic Server Application Upgrade Tooling makes it easy for you to upgrade your WebLogic Server applications to a new WebLogic version or an updated JDK. WebLogic Server application upgrade tooling employs [Rewrite WebLogic](https://github.com/oracle/rewrite-recipes/blob/main/rewrite-weblogic/README.md) recipes that perform all the functions you need to successfully upgrade your applications. Rewrite WebLogic is part of a larger, [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) project, in which you'll find lots of community recipes; recipes that are customizable and extensible for your own use. Recipes from Oracle are supported by Oracle.
